# Churn-Prediction
## 1. Introduction
   The primary objective is to develop a churn prediction model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning. This model will enable proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. Specifically, the model should:
         
        1. Predict whether a customer is likely to churn within a defined future time period (e.g., next month).
        2. Provide insights into the key factors influencing churn, empowering the business to take targeted actions.
        3. Offer a scalable solution that can be integrated into existing systems for real-time or periodic churn prediction.''')
